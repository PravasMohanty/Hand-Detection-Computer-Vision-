# Hand-Detection-Computer-Vision-
This project is a Python-based hand-tracking module designed to detect and track hand movements in real time using the MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries. The module identifies hand landmarks and provides visualization for applications in gesture recognition, virtual reality, and more.

# Features
Real-time Hand Detection: Detects and tracks hands from video input.
Landmark Recognition: Identifies up to 21 hand landmarks per hand.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust detection and tracking confidence thresholds.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly with any webcam or video feed.

*Prerequisites and requirements*
Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
Libraries used : cv2(OpenCV) , mediapipe
Access to a webcam for real-time tracking.
